This project is a search engine that uses your location and desired inputs to provide you with a weather forecast and associated information regarding current and upcoming space and earth events in order to maximize your viewing experience all against a backdrop of striking visuals provided to you by NASA's Astronomical Picture of the Day. 

# Requirements

This project was designed to be used on any web browser.

# Installation

This project does not require installation.

# Technology/Framework

This project was created using html, css, and javascript and incorporates bootstrap, UIKit, and jQuery libraries. This project uses NASA Open APIs and the OpenWeatherMap API.

# How to Use

Use the next and previous buttons in the upper left corner to change the background image. New images are downloaded daily from the NASA Astronomical Picture of the Day API. At any time, click the "Terms to Know" button to access explanations for commonly used terms. To get started, click the "Get Started" button and select either "Earth" or "Space" events. Next, confirm your location (from local storage if you have saved a favorite location or from your browser's geolocation information) or enter your city. When the results screen is displayed, access upcoming weather forecasts by clicking the "Weather Results" button, access the events by clicking the "Event Results" button, or start over by clicking the "Search Again" button. Space events are retrieved from the NASA Space Weather Database of Notifications, Knowledge, and Information (DONKI) API. Earth events are retrieved from the NASA Earth Observation and Natural Event Tracker. A Google Earth link is provided to explore the indicated area.
